                            <p class="indexparagraph">&nbsp; One of the things I have spent the most time doing lately is exercising. Especially during Covid-19, the stress levels were very high, and running, outdoors without a mask allowed me to get enough air in.</p>
                            <p class="indexparagraph">Meditation was another activity that I practiced regularly,  and still do. I practice something called &ldquo;Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya&rdquo;, which is  a yogic practice offered by a teacher named Sadhguru. He also offers a lot of  very good insights into numerous things on YouTube. I definitely recommend looking  into him if you are someone who is interested in spiritual aspects of life or finding better ways to think about things. It is not religious.</p>
                            <p class="indexparagraph">Swimming is another activity that I love, and I have been swimming  ever since I was 5 years old. My neighborhood has a pool that I can use to swim  laps in the morning over the summer. During the year I sometimes use the YMCA  to swim. I prefer swimming over running due to it being a full body workout, as  well as it involving much less impact. </p>
                            <p class="indexparagraph">Video games is something that has stuck with me since childhood,  as games have gotten much better and more interesting, as well as more  addicting. I used to play massive multiplayer online games like &ldquo;Runescape&rdquo; and  &ldquo;World of Warcraft&rdquo; as a kid because there weren&rsquo;t many friends that lived near  me, so it allowed me to make friends and play games online with them. I still  play some of these today, but not as much. </p>
                            <p class="indexparagraph">Lastly, I am of course very interested in coding and  learning how to write programs. Even though I have only just started, it is  already fun to be able to write simple things in the Coral language. I have realized  just how much is possible to do with programming. I like the creativity involved  and the freedom it allows as you get better. I am planning on choosing Java for  my degree and will be learning python over the summer.            </p>
