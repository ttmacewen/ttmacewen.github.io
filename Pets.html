                                        <p class="indexparagraph">I have no  pets currently, but I used to have 3 cats, which I had for over half of my  life. I had a dog named Bennett growing up, which I always thought was a weird  name because at that age I had never heard of Bennett as being a last name. We  got him for free from a neighbor because he kept running into our lawn and he  was already named Bennett, but at least we didn&rsquo;t get his brother Ooboo. Most  of Bennett&rsquo;s life was spent shocking himself by running past the electric  fence. </p>
<p class="indexparagraph">While we  still had Bennett, we got my first cat Oliver from the animal shelter when I was  in 4th grade, even though my mom was allergic to cats. Bennett and  Oliver got a long pretty well, but Bennett passed away 2 years later from a  seizure. Oliver was lonely after Bennett was gone, so we were looking to get  another cat. The Veterinarian told us that if we get a new cat, and Oliver  doesn&rsquo;t like them, then that cat will be lonely. Great logic, I don&rsquo;t know if  you could ever stop making that case for any amount of cats you get, but we  believed the Vet and got 2 more cats instead of 1. They were also brother and  sister so we didn&rsquo;t want to split them up. </p>
<p class="indexparagraph">We named  the new cats Brody and Cleo, and they fought constantly. They were all great cats  though, and Oliver got a long well with them. Brody and Oliver were outside  cats and killed lots of small animals and left them on our deck. They all three  passed away though not too long after moving to NC from Delaware. It was  probably for the best, since it was not really possible for them to keep going  outside anymore after we moved. I no longer have any of my own pets but once I am living on my own I will probably get a cat. I often have to now take care of my sister's dogs.</p>
